# Golf-Website
A Python Flask website for golf players who can store scores and bets they make against other players.

Players can sign up and make an account with a username, email, and handicap. Players can add scores, update their handicaps, update their passwords, and add bets when they play against other players (on the same day and golf course).

The betting scheme is played by hole with pressures, units, and match. All data is stored in SQL.

It gets the job done. (My first website using Flask)
